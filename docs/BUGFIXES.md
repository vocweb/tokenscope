## Data accuracy (call counting)

### 1. Skills invoked via slash command were not counted

- **Symptom**: Calling a skill with `/find-skills` never showed up in the panel;
  the count stayed on an unrelated skill (`summary-recorder`).
- **Cause**: A slash-command invocation is logged as a **`user` message** with a
  `<command-name>/find-skills</command-name>` tag — **not** as a `Skill`
  `tool_use` block. The parser only looked at `tool_use`, so slash-command
  skills were invisible. (`summary-recorder` was a real, older `Skill` call that
  happened to fall inside the visible time window.)
- **Fix**: Added `parse_user_command` in `store.rs` to extract the skill name
  from the `<command-name>` tag. These command events carry no model/tokens, so
  `Agg.add` in `parser.rs` guards request/model accounting with
  `!model.is_empty()` to avoid inflating request counts or creating an
  empty-named model. Bumped `STORE_VERSION` to force a one-time full rescan.

### 2. Tool calls dropped when one message spanned multiple log lines

- **Symptom**: A model-invoked skill (`skill-creator`) produced a real `Skill`
  `tool_use`, yet still wasn't counted.
- **Cause**: A single assistant message (same `message.id`) is split across
  several JSONL lines — e.g. `thinking` on one line, `tool_use` on the next,
  **both repeating the same `usage`**. The store deduped **by `message.id` and
  dropped whole duplicate lines**, so the line carrying the `tool_use` was
  discarded after the `thinking` line was ingested first. This also silently
  dropped MCP calls in the same shape.
- **Fix**: Replaced the drop-on-duplicate logic in `store.rs` with a
  merge: keep an `id → index` map, and when a line repeats a known id, **merge
  its `mcp`/`skills` into the existing event without re-counting tokens** (usage
  is identical across the split lines, so it's still counted once). Bumped
  `STORE_VERSION` for a full rescan.

### 3. Delta percentage was ~100× too small (and hidden)

- **Symptom**: The Day view showed no change percentage next to Total tokens.
- **Cause**: `pct_delta` computed `((cur-prev)/prev*100).round()/100`, which
  cancels the `×100` and returns a **fraction** (e.g. `0.2`) instead of a
  **percentage** (`20`). The UI rounds the value to an integer for display, so
  `0.2 → 0%`, and the "hide when 0" rule then hid it entirely.
- **Fix**: Changed `pct_delta` to `((cur-prev)/prev*10000).round()/100`, which
  returns a real percentage with 2 decimals (e.g. `20.47`).

### 17. MCP / Skill calls were counted for Claude Code only

- **Symptom**: A user whose week is 99.8% Oh My Pi (21k requests, 20 sessions)
  saw **MCP calls 0** and **Skill calls 1** — the two cards looked broken, and
  neither matched reality (36 real skill invocations that week).
- **Cause**: Only `parse_assistant` extracted MCP / Skill calls. `parse_omp_line`
  and `parse_pi_message` hardcoded `mcp: Vec::new(), skills: Vec::new()`, and
  codex never looked at `function_call` at all, so every non-Claude agent's tool
  calls were dropped. The whitelists were Claude-only too (`~/.claude.json`
  `mcpServers` + `~/.claude/skills`), and Oh My Pi flattens an MCP call into one
  name (`xd_mcp__<server>_<tool>`) that can never equal a configured server key.
- **Fix**: Extract tool calls from every ingested agent — Oh My Pi / pi from
  their `toolCall` content blocks (MCP via the shared `mcp_candidate`, a skill
  when the call reads `skill://<id>` itself, not a file inside it), codex from
  `response_item`/`function_call` names buffered onto the usage row that follows.
  `config.rs` now unions the installed MCP servers (each agent's own
  `mcp.json` / Codex's `[mcp_servers.*]`) and skill folders across agents, and
  resolves a candidate by normalized longest prefix so `chrome_devtools_navigate_page`
  matches the `chrome-devtools` the user configured. Bumped `STORE_VERSION` to 9.
- **Note**: forced rescans are therefore unavoidable for extraction changes, and
  this one also replaced a cache that held far more Oh My Pi requests than the
  logs do (36,638 cached vs 21,182 recomputed from the JSONL). The rescan output
  matches the logs, so the corrected numbers are the right ones; the inflation
  source itself is still open (cf. the re-read idempotency class in `REVIEW.md`).

### 18. Claude Code's streamed output tokens were frozen at the opening chunk

- **Symptom**: The **5H** view under-reported Claude Code's output tokens — on
  this machine 0.112M recorded against 0.496M in the logs, i.e. **~69% of the
  window's output missing**. Input and cache were exact, so the shortfall
  showed up only as a suspiciously small "output" share and a cost that barely
  moved. (The **provider-reported** plan-limit rows — "Claude · 5 Hour",
  "Claude · 7 Day" — were unaffected and still live.)
- **Cause**: Claude Code **re-appends the whole assistant line as the response
  streams**, so one `message.id` appears repeatedly in a file with `output_tokens`
  climbing on each copy (measured on a 6 h window: 355 of 647 ids ended above
  their first count, while `input` / `cache_creation` / `cache_read` never
  changed). `push_event` deduped Claude repeats by **merging tool calls and
  keeping the first line's tokens** — correct for the case it was written for (one
  message split across a thinking line and a `tool_use` line), but it froze every
  streamed response at its opening chunk.
- **Fix**: Claude repeats now merge tool calls *and* take the token reading from
  the newest line that actually carries one (`Store::has_usage`), so an early copy
  with no numbers never overwrites a stored reading either. Bumped
  `STORE_VERSION` to 10 so existing caches are rebuilt from the logs.
- **Verify**: raw-JSONL last-wins recomputation vs the store, same 5 h window —
  output 0.112M → **0.483M** against a ground truth of 0.496M. `cargo test --lib`
  49/49 with two new regression tests (streamed repeats take the latest reading
  and still merge tool calls; a usage-free repeat does not erase one).

## Release & distribution (CI)

### 4. Release CI failed: empty Apple signing env var

- **Symptom**: The `v0.1.1` build failed at the bundle step with
  `security: SecKeychainItemImport: ... parameters ... not valid` /
  `failed to import keychain certificate`.
- **Cause**: The workflow passed `APPLE_CERTIFICATE: ${{ secrets.APPLE_CERTIFICATE }}`,
  but the secret didn't exist, so it became an **empty string**. Tauri's bundler
  treats the env var's *presence* as "a certificate was provided" and tries to
  `security import` empty data, which fails. (Local builds were fine because the
  var was *unset*, not empty.)
- **Fix**: Commented out the Apple signing/notarization env in `release.yml`
  until the real secrets exist. The build now does ad-hoc signing, like local.

### 5. GitHub Release had no .dmg / .app — it was a draft

- **Symptom**: "The release has no artifacts."
- **Cause**: `releaseDraft: true` — the build *did* succeed and attach the
  `.dmg` + `.app.tar.gz`, but a **draft release is invisible in the public
  Releases list** and its asset URLs return 404, so Homebrew can't download it.
  (The artifacts were also not in the Actions "Artifacts" tab, because
  `tauri-action` uploads to Releases.)
- **Fix**: Set `releaseDraft: false` so each tag publishes immediately and the
  asset URL is live for the Homebrew step and `brew install`.

### 6. Homebrew Cask step would hash a 404 page

- **Symptom**: Latent — the cask `sha256` could be computed from an error page.
- **Cause**: The cask step fetched the asset with `curl -sL` (no `-f`), so a 404
  returned `0` and the GitHub error HTML got hashed into a bogus checksum,
  breaking `brew install` with a `sha256 mismatch`.
- **Fix**: Use `curl -fsSL` so a missing asset fails and retries; fail loudly
  (`exit 1`) if the asset never appears.

### 7. DMG name didn't match the tag

- **Symptom**: A `v0.1.1` tag would build `Tokenscope_0.1.0_universal.dmg`,
  which the cask step (computing the name from the tag) couldn't download → 404.
- **Cause**: Tauri names the artifact from the version in `tauri.conf.json`,
  which was still `0.1.0` while the tag was `v0.1.1`.
- **Fix**: Bump the version in `package.json`, `tauri.conf.json`, and
  `Cargo.toml` (+ `Cargo.lock`) so the built DMG name matches the tag the cask
  step expects.

## App behavior & packaging

### 8. Two menu-bar icons after reinstall

- **Symptom**: Reinstalling/relaunching left two Tokenscope icons in the menu
  bar.
- **Cause**: No single-instance guard — a second launch started a second
  process with its own tray icon.
- **Fix**: Added `tauri-plugin-single-instance` (registered first) so a second
  launch hands off to the running instance (showing the popover) and exits.

### 9. Unsigned app blocked by Gatekeeper on first open

- **Symptom**: "Apple cannot verify Tokenscope.app is free of malware."
- **Cause**: The build is unsigned/unnotarized, and Homebrew adds a quarantine
  attribute to installed apps.
- **Fix**: Added a `postflight` to the cask that runs `xattr -cr` on the
  installed app, so `brew install` opens cleanly. (The `.dmg` path still needs a
  manual right-click → Open or `xattr -cr`; a full fix needs Developer ID
  signing + notarization.)

### 10. App icon had opaque white corners

- **Symptom**: The rounded app icon showed white square corners in Launchpad.
- **Cause**: The icon PNGs had a white (opaque) background in the corners
  instead of transparent alpha.
- **Fix**: Regenerated the icon from a clean transparent source
  (`scripts/gen_icon.py`, 4× supersampled), then ran `pnpm tauri icon` to
  produce every size + `icon.icns` / `icon.ico` with transparent corners.

## UI / charts

### 11. Bar-chart tooltip overlapped the legend above it

- **Symptom**: Hovering a token bar showed its tooltip floating up over the
  Total-tokens "Input … cached" legend, even for short bars.
- **Cause**: To make short bars easy to hover, the hit area was stretched to the
  full column height (`alignSelf: stretch`). The tooltip then anchored to the
  column's `top` — i.e. the top of the chart, right under the legend — so every
  bar's tooltip appeared at the same high spot.
- **Fix** (`charts.tsx` + `tokenscope-panel.html`): anchor the tooltip to the
  *visible bar top* (`r.bottom − barPx`, baseline minus bar height) instead of
  the column top, so short bars get a low tooltip clear of the legend.

### 12. Mockup tooltip drifted to the panel centre (backdrop-filter)

- **Symptom**: In `tokenscope-panel.html` only, the heatmap/bar tooltips
  appeared near the middle of the panel instead of next to the hovered cell/bar.
- **Cause**: The design board's card uses `backdrop-filter: blur(...)`. Like
  `transform`/`filter`, `backdrop-filter` establishes a **containing block for
  `position: fixed`** descendants — so the fixed tooltip anchored to the card,
  not the viewport, and its viewport coordinates landed mid-panel. The real app
  was unaffected (its card is solid, no backdrop-filter, and it needs `fixed` to
  escape the scrolling card).
- **Fix** (`tokenscope-panel.html` only): position the tooltips `absolute`
  relative to each chart's own wrapper (coords offset from the wrapper rect).
  The mockup never scrolls, so it doesn't need `fixed`.

### 13. Total-tokens bar showed slivers when usage was zero

- **Symptom**: With no usage in the period (Total = 0.00M), the input/output
  split bar still showed a small coloured sliver instead of being empty.
- **Cause**: Each segment had `minWidth: 4`, so even a `flexGrow` of `1e-6`
  rendered a 4px block — two slivers when everything was zero.
- **Fix** (`App.tsx` + `tokenscope-panel.html`): give the bar a track background
  and only render the coloured segments when `totalTokens > 0`; otherwise the
  bar is just the empty track.

### 16. Total-tokens split bar didn't fill — gray track showed through

- **Symptom**: The 2-colour split bar under Total tokens read as only partly
  filled — coloured segments on the left, gray track visible on the right —
  instead of always 100% when there was usage. Most visible when the split was
  lopsided (e.g. right after clearing stats, with output ≈ 0).
- **Cause**: The two segments used `flexGrow` + `flexBasis: 0` (+ `minWidth: 4`).
  In the WebKit webview that combination sizes each segment to roughly **its own
  grow factor as an absolute fraction of the bar**, not the **grow-factor ratio**
  — so `flexGrow` 0.10 vs 1e-6 covered ~10% of the bar, not ~100%, and the track
  showed through. The data was correct (verified by dumping `build_dashboard`'s
  JSON and computing the expected ratio); only the rendering was wrong.
- **Fix** (`src/App.tsx`): use explicit `width: X%` instead of `flexGrow`
  (interpreted correctly, always sums to exactly 100%). While here, re-purposed
  the bar from input+cache vs output to **cached vs rest (uncached input +
  output)**: the dark segment is the cache share (matching the "% cached" label),
  and "rest" is wider than output-alone, so a small non-cached share still reads
  past the pill's rounded corner without distorting the ratio. Pill shape kept;
  the `SplitLegend` below was changed from "Input / Output" to "Cached / New" to
  match. (A temporary "清零" tray menu item — clearing the cache and
  fast-forwarding ingest offsets — was used to reproduce the lopsided state, then
  removed.)

## Theme

### 14. "System" theme mode didn't follow the macOS appearance

- **Symptom**: On macOS, the "System" theme option didn't track the OS dark/light
  mode — neither when toggling system appearance with the popover open, nor after
  quitting and relaunching the app (it stayed on the launch-time appearance).
  Windows was unaffected.
- **Cause**: The frontend derived the system appearance entirely from
  `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")` (`App.tsx`). But Tokenscope
  is an `Accessory` (menu-bar) app whose popover is a **non-activating `NSPanel`**
  that is `order_out`'d (hidden) most of the time. In that configuration
  WKWebView's `prefers-color-scheme` is unreliable: it doesn't reliably fire the
  `change` event on a system theme switch while the webview is hidden, and at
  launch an Accessory app's `NSApp.effectiveAppearance` (what WKWebView reports)
  may not be synced to the current system value — so even a fresh restart reads
  the wrong appearance.
- **Fix**: Read the OS dark-mode setting natively in Rust and push it to the
  frontend via a Tauri event, bypassing the webview. `system_is_dark()` reads
  `NSUserDefaults`'s `AppleInterfaceStyle` (the user's **global** system
  preference, independent of app focus). `watch_system_theme()` listens on
  `NSDistributedNotificationCenter` for `AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification`
  — delivered to every registered app regardless of activation policy or
  frontmost status — and `emit("system-theme", dark)`. `setup()` also emits once
  at startup to correct any stale webview value. The frontend's
  `listen("system-theme")` updates `systemDark`; the existing `matchMedia`
  listener stays as the source of truth on Windows / browser preview. macOS-only
  (`#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`), no new dependencies — uses the `objc`/`cocoa`/
  `block` re-exports already imported in `lib.rs`. (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`,
  `src/App.tsx`)

### 15. Selected period pill flashed white→transparent on a light→dark switch

- **Symptom**: After the fix above, switching the system theme from light to dark
  while the popover was hidden, then opening it, showed a brief "white →
  transparent" fade on the currently-selected period pill (Day/Week/Month) for a
  moment — most visible element of an otherwise-instant flip.
- **Cause**: The `Segmented` selected pill carries
  `transition: "color .15s, background .15s"` (`charts.tsx`), wanted for smooth
  period-switching. On a *whole-theme* flip this turns every color change into a
  cross-fade; the white selected background fading into the dark one was the most
  jarring. Because the panel is hidden when the theme change lands, the first
  painted frame on open is still the old light theme, then the new theme is
  applied and the transition animates the change visibly.
- **Fix**: Suppress per-property transitions across a theme flip so the panel
  repaints in the new theme in one step. Added a global `.ts-no-transition` rule
  (`main.tsx`) and an effect (`App.tsx`) that adds it to `<html>` when `dark`
  changes and removes it after two `requestAnimationFrame`s. Because rAF callbacks
  don't run while the window is hidden, the class stays on until the popover is
  shown — so the first visible frame is already the new theme with no transition,
  then transitions are restored for normal interactions (e.g. clicking
  Day/Week/Month still animates). Skipped on the very first render.
  (`src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`)

## Notes

- "Month" was also changed from a rolling 30-day window to the **current
  calendar month vs the previous calendar month** — a behavior change requested
  during testing, not a bug.
- "Week" was likewise changed from a rolling last-7-days window to the **current
  calendar week (Monday–Sunday) vs the previous calendar week**, so the delta
  compares this week against last week.
- Delta colors were swapped so usage/cost **up = red** (bad), **down = green**
  (good).
